## 🔗 API Integration This project uses the [Hacker News Algolia API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) to fetch live data: - **Category Pages** → `https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query={category}&tags=story`

- The API integration ensures stories, comments, and search results are always up‑to‑date.

## 🧭 Development Journey

- **Phase 1: Static Pages**  
  Initially, each category (Tech, Science, Games, Business, etc.) had its own static page. This proved the concept but quickly became repetitive.

- **Phase 2: Realization & Refactor**  
  I realized the need for a smarter solution: a single dynamic `[category]` route. This eliminated duplication and made the app scalable.

- **Phase 3: Elegant Navbar**  
  Introduced a `newsCategories` array. Each category name maps automatically to a lowercase path (e.g., `"AI"` → `/ai`).  
  The Navbar `.map()` renders links dynamically, so adding new categories is as simple as updating the array.

- **Phase 4: User‑Friendly Polish**  
  Added animations, scroll‑aware shadow, responsive mobile menu, and trending section.

- **Phase 5: Recruiter‑Friendly Polish** Added animations, scroll‑aware shadow, responsive mobile menu, and trending section.
